# Typescript

Typescript is the superset of Javascript. The reason we say it is a superset is because the Typescript code that we write gets transpiled to JavaScript code. Typescript has lots of benefits and it is a language that scales Javascript. So yes, it is always good to use Typescript if you have a large codebase. Typescript code can run on any OS, any host and any browser. It is completely open source so you can always look at their codebase and also contribute if required.
